                <H2>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASIAN AND AFRICAN ELEPHANTS? AND 10 OTHER ELEPHANT FACTS</H2>

                    <b>1. What's the difference between Asian and African elephants?</b>
                    There are more than 10 physical characteristics that differentiate Asian and African elephants. For example, Asian elephants' ears are
                    smaller compared to the large fan-shaped ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks, while both male and 
                    female African elephants grow tusks. It is also important to note that there are two distinct elephants species on the African continent—
                    the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both as well.
                    <p></p>
                    <b>2. How many species of African elephant are there?</b>
                    Following new genetic research, the African elephant was recently split into two different species, the African forest elephant and the African savanna elephant, by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List conservation assessment. The African forest elephant is now listed as Critically Endangered, and the African savanna elephant as Endangered. This is important because they face different conservation challenges and occur in separate ranges and habitats throughout Africa.
                    <p></p>
                    <b>3. How are African forest elephants and African savanna elephants different from one another?</b>
                    African forest elephants inhabit the dense rain forest of west and central Africa, while African savanna elephants mostly inhabit the wooded savannas and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa. They also differ physically. African savanna elephants are larger and their tusks curve outward. The tusks of the smaller African forest elephant are straighter, pointing downward, and they have more rounded ears.
                    <p></p>
                    <b>4. How many muscles does an elephant trunk have?</b>
                    An elephant trunk has up to 40,000 muscles. A human has more than 600 muscles in the entire body. Elephants use their trunks to help them suck up water for drinking, pick up or touch objects, trumpet warnings, and greet one another.
                    <p></p>
                    <b>5. Do elephants have a dominant tusk?</b>
                    Elephants are either left- or right-tusked, and the dominant tusk is generally smaller because of wear and tear from frequent use.
                    <p></p>
                    <b>6. How do elephants use their tusks?</b>
                    Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.

                <H2>There is an elephant 'baby boom' going on in Kenya</H2>
                <img width="700" src="Images/elephant3.jpeg" alt="third face"/>
                <p> 
                    One National Park in Kenya is celebrating a recent elephant 'baby boom'.

                    Nestled in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro, Amboseli National Park has seen an unusually high number of elephant calve births in the last few months.

                    Roughly 1,500 elephants live in the 392-square-kilometre reservation, located along the border of Kenya and Tanzania. The National Park has seen a record number of more than 200 elephant calves born so far this year - and they're still hoping for more.

                    "December is usually a high birth month, so we'll expect more," says Founder of Amboseli Trust for Elephants, Cynthia Moss.

                    So what's changed? In short, it's the weather. There have been more severe drought cycles, which are followed by intense rainy seasons. Elephant fertility increases after heavy rains.
                
                    And that's not the only good news for elephants. The whole population has doubled over the last 30 years across Kenya, thanks to conservation efforts.

                    Although the pandemic has brought new dangers for these creatures. While ivory trading appears to have halted temporarily, there are still concerns over illegal poaching for food.

                    Back in Amboseli, Moss says one of the biggest threats to the calves now is another drought. "If say the rains fail right now, a lot of these calves will die. I do not know how many, but possibly half could die," she says.

                    The rainy season is due to begin in March and it's still uncertain what the forecast will be for 2021.
