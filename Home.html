                <P> 
                    The animal kingdom is vast group of millions of different kinds (species) of animals. 
                    Thousands more species are being discovered each year. Whatever their shape, size, 
                    or way of life, they all have some things in common.

                    Despite Tiger being the biggest among all the cats, 
                    the lion is called the king of the jungle not because it's the strongest but because the lion poses 
                    kingship abilities that the Tigers don't.. <a href="https://subuinfo.com/international-news/lion-vs-tiger-who-is-king/" > click here for more details</a> 
                    Lion Vs Tiger: Of course when you ask anyone who's the king of the jungle he / she answers fast saying, the Lion. Because this is the truth that we learned as a
                    child, but did you ever think why the lion is the king of the jungle and not any other animal?
                    Many other powerful animals possess qualities that enable them to obtain the title of king of the beasts and if we put them in comparison with the lion, we will
                    find that the closest of them is the Tiger. So why is the tiger not the King of the Jungle?
                    <p></p>
                    There are many differences between these two big cats their appearance is the most obvious difference between a lion and a tiger. Tigers have bold black stripes
                    across their bodies whereas lions don't have any stripes. Tigers also don't have Mane's like the male lions. Male lions have a large main around their faces the
                    physical characteristics also differ between lions and tigers.
