                <H2>The Only Monkeys That Soak in Hot Springs to Lower Their Stress: Japan’s Bathing Monkey Mystery</H2>
                <img width="700" src="images/monkey1.jpeg" alt="monkey"/>
                <p> 
                    Humans love spas, sauna bathing, hot baths; after a cold day what could be better? Japan has a famous troupe of wild monkeys that also love a relaxing soak in the country’s hot springs, and after delighting 
                    
                    tourists for decades, scientists have decided to finally sort out the behavioral particulars of this fascinating trait.
                    
                    What they found was that monkeys not only use the hot springs for warmth in their frigid winter environment, but that they serve to bring down the levels of stress hormones in the monkeys’ brains.

                    Near the site of the last Winter Olympics lies the town of Nagano. Here ,Japanese macaques exhibit a strange behavior.

                    Bathing monkeys is a more common sight in India and China, but only in Nagano have monkeys been recording bathing in hot water.

                    Other macaques live further north than Nagano, so it’s clear the species is adapted to cold weather, however despite the fact that the local environment is filled with natural hot springs, the 140° F water temperature is too hot.

                    Nearby hotels use cool water to bring that scalding temperature down to one that guests find enjoyable, and in 1963, a female monkey was found relaxing in one such pool.

                    Eventually it caught on, and the monkeys became a nuisance and a health hazard; so a park was built nearby where the monkeys had exclusive access to several 104° pools.

                    Having obvious use as a therapy for the cold, recent tests have aimed to determine whether there was any other driver of this novel behavior.

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering primates’ strong social bonds, a stress hormone called glucocorticoids, which is known to be elevated by cold weather, were considerably lower in the animals’ fecal matter after periods of bathing.

                    Rafaela S.C. Takeshita from the University of Kyoto admitted that spending so much time watching the macaques relax in the hot springs rubbed off on her.

                    “I confess that during my research, many times after, I jumped into one of the hot springs pools,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/science/japan-monkeys-hot-springs-stress.html" > told the New York Times,</a>  adding that it was the humans-only pool.

                    A photo of a golden silk monkey looking very uncomfortable has won first prize at the Comedy Wildlife Awards 2021. The competition winners were revealed on BBC’s The One Show in front of a million viewers, making it the first time it’s been publicized on TV.

                    Ken Jensen from Blackburn, England, was this year's overall winner with his photo entitled 'Ouch!' The winning shot was taken on a bridge that runs over the river Xun in the Longsheng Gorge in Yunnan, China, during a family holiday in 2016. Golden silk monkeys freely roam the area and are often found playing on the bridge, unfazed by human interaction. Ken managed to snap one particular male monkey while it sat on one of the supporting ropes with a look of sheer surprise on its face. It just goes to show, sometimes, timing really is everything.

                    In reaction to the good news, Ken said, “ I was absolutely overwhelmed to learn that my entry had won, especially when there were quite a number of wonderful photos entered. The publicity that my image has received over the last few months has been incredible, it is such a great feeling to that that one's image is making people smile globally as well as helping to support some fantastically worthwhile conservation causes”.

                    As the 2021 Comedy Wildlife Photographer of the Year, Ken won a once-in-a-lifetime trip to go to the Masai Mara in Kenya on safari. He will also receive a unique handmade trophy from the Wonder Workshop in Tanzania, a photography bag from Think Tank and a goodie bag full to the brim.

                    Founded in 2015 the competition is now in its seventh year, and during its time has received entries from all corners of the world. Other notable category winners this year include John Speirs who won both the Affinity People’s Choice Award and the Creature of Air Award for his photo of a pigeon with a leaf over its face. Chee Kee Teo won the Creatures of the Water Award for an image depicting an unimpressed young otter with its mother, entitled ‘Time for School’ while Vicki Jauron won the Portfolio Award with a series of images showing a young elephant taking a mud bath. 

                    Not only does the competition provide a platform for photographers to share their funniest shots, it also helps to promote wildlife conservation. This year, 10 % of the total net revenue made will be donated to <a href="https://www.savewildorangutans.org" > Save Wild Orangutangs </a>  – an initiative that safeguards wild orangutans in and around Gunung Palang National Park, Borneo.

                <H2>Monkeys’ reactions to computer-generated videos suggest they, like humans, suffer from the creepy “uncanny valley” effect</H2>
                <img width="700" src="Images/monkey3.jpeg" alt="third monkey"/>

                    (Inside Science) -- Whether it’s an android, computer graphics in a movie, or a live Tupac hologram, animated representations of people can sometimes creep viewers out if the images don’t seem quite right. Now, new research suggests that monkeys may get creeped out by bad imitations, too.

                    Researchers have long noted that humans are more comfortable with things that look like people, but only to a certain point -- we sometimes have an aversion to things that are almost like us but a little off. Such an effect has been described as the “uncanny valley.”

                    One possible explanation is that an abnormal-looking human image may appear similar to a human with some sort of contagious disease -- something we have evolved to avoid. At the same time, we aren’t as averse to wholly unrealistic robots or holograms. It’s possible that we aren’t as worried about avoiding these unrealistic avatars since a disease would be less likely to spread from something that may not even be the same species, Siebert said.

                    The team found a similar effect with a type of monkey called the rhesus macaque. First, they created sophisticated images of monkeys using programs that tracked the movements and behavior of actual monkeys. They then played back videos of monkey avatars to live monkeys, using an eye-tracking program to see how much attention the monkeys paid to the videos.

                    The researchers played back avatars of four different qualities, ranging from realistic to basic outlines. They found that the macaques paid the most attention to actual videos of real monkeys as well as the most simplistic avatar, followed closely by the best avatar. However, the monkeys paid less attention to intermediate versions of the avatar that were done in grayscale or were otherwise lacking major features.

                    They also found that when presented with videos of real monkeys and the most realistic avatars, monkeys were more likely to perform a peaceful, affiliative gesture called lip-smacking. When presented with one of the intermediate-quality avatars, monkeys showed higher use of a the “fear grin,” a facial expression that signals fear. The researchers believe this shows that the avatars with a moderate level of detail fall into the uncanny valley, causing unease in their primate viewers. The study was published today in the journal eNeuro.

                    The researchers said this discovery provides evidence that the uncanny valley effect may have an ancient evolutionary origin, since monkeys apparently experience the same thing. They also believe this discovery may help researchers who study rhesus monkey behavior to design better experiments. Video avatars can be useful for evaluating how monkeys respond to different prompts, but the results could be skewed if the avatars are creeping the monkeys out.
